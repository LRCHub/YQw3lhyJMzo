[00:00.60] ♪
[00:14.93] Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
[00:21.04] Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
[00:26.45] So let's pretend a little longer
[00:31.92] 'Cause when we're gone
[00:34.32] Everything goes on
[00:39.34] Well, you were staring at the window
[00:44.66] And I said, "I wanna take you to the sea"
[00:51.81] And when I'm better, we'll do everything
[00:56.42] I gotta stop making promises I can't keep
[01:02.82] But if I was gone tomorrow, won't the waves crash on?
[01:08.82] Is it selfish that I'm happy as we pass the setting sun?
[01:14.81] Someday I'll be overcast, but you won't have to cry
[01:22.22] 'Cause we'll do the grieving while I'm by your side
[01:26.98] I said
[01:28.30] Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
[01:34.34] Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
[01:39.78] So let's pretend a little longer
[01:45.31] 'Cause when we're gone
[01:47.75] Everything goes on
[01:50.96] ♪
[02:05.29] And I'm so scared of getting used to this
[02:10.16] All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
[02:17.51] Someday both of us are leaving here
[02:22.15] But for now, I'll just bring to the sea to you, ooh
[02:28.31] When you meet me in the daylight like we did before
[02:34.38] Then I felt you on my shoulder, and you weren't suffering anymore
[02:40.39] You said, "I'm sorry that you worry, but don't apologize"
[02:47.06] I told you to forget me, but you stayed by my side
[02:52.71] When I said
[02:53.99] Don't try to make yourself remember, darling
[03:00.07] Don't look for me, I'm just a story you've been told
[03:05.46] So let's pretend a little longer
[03:11.06] And when we're gone, ah
[03:16.38] Everything goes on
